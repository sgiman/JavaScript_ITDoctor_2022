 ## JavaScript Lessons - ITDoctor (2022)

The JavaScript course from scratch consists of 12 lessons. In this course you will learn the basics of a programming language,
without which it is impossible to study libraries, frameworks or create your own interesting scripts.
In 12 lessons you will learn to work with variables of different types, arrays, objects,
learn how to check conditions and create loops. Learn to create your own functions,
work with date and time, document code correctly and catch errors.

It also talks about the object-oriented approach to programming in JavaScript and
interesting features of the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) standard are considered,
which is already very well supported by all browsers and does not require additional compilation
to older versions of the ES standard. This course has its logical continuation in the form of the "Super JavaScript" course.
You can learn more about the Super JavaScript course after completing this course.
